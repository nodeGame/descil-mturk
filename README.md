# DeSciL-mturk

API to connect to the Mturk service provided by the ETH Decision Science Laboratory (DeSciL).

## Setup

Create a `conf` directory at the top of the root tree and add a file called `descil.conf.js` containing the following lines:

```javascript
  module.exports.key = "zyx";
  module.exports.project = "xyx";
  module.exports.uri = "http://xxx.xxx";
```

## Usage

The DeSciL Mturk service is still in beta. If you are interested in testing the `descil-mturk` API, contact the lab manager to receive valid credentials.
